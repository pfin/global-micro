# RatesLib Analysis for Next.js Integration

## Overview
RatesLib is a Python library with Rust extensions (via PyO3) for fixed income analysis. It's designed for quantitative finance professionals working with bonds, swaps, and other derivatives.

## Architecture
- **Primary Language**: Python
- **Performance Extensions**: Rust (using PyO3 bindings)
- **Not WebAssembly Ready**: Currently designed as a Python library with native Rust extensions

## Key Components

### Python Side
- Fixed income instruments (bonds, swaps, FX derivatives)
- Curve construction and calibration
- Risk calculations (automatic differentiation)
- Financial conventions and calendars

### Rust Side (rust/ directory)
- Performance-critical calculations
- Dual numbers for automatic differentiation
- Spline interpolation
- Calendar operations
- FX rate calculations
- SABR volatility functions

## Can We Use It in Next.js?

### Current State: NO
RatesLib is currently a Python library with Rust extensions compiled for Python (PyO3). It cannot be directly used in a browser/Next.js environment.

### Potential Solutions:

#### 1. **Compile Rust to WebAssembly** (Difficult)
- Would require significant refactoring
- Need to remove PyO3 dependencies
- Create JavaScript/TypeScript bindings instead
- Reimplement Python-specific logic in Rust
- Use wasm-pack to compile to WebAssembly

#### 2. **Server-Side API** (Recommended)
- Run RatesLib on a Python server (FastAPI/Django)
- Expose REST/GraphQL API endpoints
- Next.js frontend calls the API
- Keeps the library in its native environment

#### 3. **Port to JavaScript/TypeScript** (Most Work)
- Manually reimplement the algorithms
- Could reference the Rust code for performance-critical parts
- Would be a separate project

## Comparison with QuantLib

| Feature | QuantLib-WASM | RatesLib |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Language | C++ | Python + Rust |
| WebAssembly | ✅ Available | ❌ Not available |
| Browser Support | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Maturity | Very mature | Modern, actively developed |
| Fixed Income | Comprehensive | Specialized for fixed income |
| API Design | Object-oriented C++ style | Pythonic, modern |

## Recommendation

For a Next.js frontend displaying yield curves:

1. **Use QuantLib-WASM** for client-side calculations (already set up)
2. **Consider RatesLib** for server-side calculations if you need:
   - More modern Python API
   - Specific fixed income features
   - Integration with Python data science ecosystem

3. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - QuantLib-WASM for interactive client-side features
   - RatesLib API server for complex calculations
   - Next.js as the frontend framework

## Technical Challenges for WebAssembly Port

If attempting to compile RatesLib to WebAssembly:

1. Remove all PyO3 dependencies
2. Replace Python-specific features with Rust equivalents
3. Create JavaScript bindings using wasm-bindgen
4. Handle memory management for JavaScript
5. Rewrite tests for JavaScript environment
6. Create TypeScript definitions

This would be a significant undertaking and might not be worth the effort compared to using the existing QuantLib-WASM solution.
