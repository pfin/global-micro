Since I cannot directly access the Medium article, I need to research the key steps for implementing QuantLib in JavaScript based on the approach described.

## Key Steps from the Article:

1. Download and compile QuantLib with Emscripten
2. Create C++ wrapper functions that expose QuantLib functionality
3. Use Embind to create JavaScript bindings
4. Compile to WebAssembly
5. Create JavaScript interface layer
6. Test in browser environment

The article likely covers:
- Setting up Emscripten environment
- Creating wrapper functions for yield curves
- Handling memory management between C++ and JavaScript
- Building the WebAssembly module
- Using the module in a web application
